## Negotiaphobia
- Like sales, negotiation is something that a lot of people don't like doing. Why?
- Fear of failure
- Fear of confrontation
---
## Goal of negotiation
- What are we trying to achieve?
- Win-win?
- We are always trying to win
- Never complain... negotiate a solution
---
## Why does negotiating matter?
- A lot of important things can hang on it
- War
- Trade/economic success
- The success of your venture
---
## The danger of price-based competition
---
## The reality
- It's creative
- It's real-time
- It’s about people
- Seller: You know they want the product/service, we're just coming up with a way of making it work
- Buyer: You've got nothing to lose...
- "... in a way, every social action is a negotiation, a compromise between 'his,' 'her' or 'their' wish and yours."  [Andy Warhol]

## Ethics

- We are the good guys
- It's a small world and getting smaller
- You may be dealing with someone for a very long time
- Beware the temptations
    - The lure of temptation [Hegarty & Sims, Universities of Indiana and Maryland]
    - Uncertainty increases the likelihood that we will be unethical [Lewicki, Ohio State University] 
    - Powerlessness: Studies found that a lack of outside options increased negotiator deception
    - Anonymous victims

## Preparation
- The importance of preparation
- Set your goal
- Power in a negotiation
- Tilting the playing field in your favour
- Sizing up the situation
- BATNA
- BATNA for sellers
- *Exercise: Understanding your negotiables*
---
## The importance of preparation
- Don't be surprised if someone wants to negotiate!
- Got to be credible
- It may be messy: The better we manage and cope with the inherent uncertainty and unpredictability of negotiation, the more effective we will be
- Information is power
---
## Set your goal
- What's your ideal deal?
- What's your "walk away/bottom line" and why?
- What's your min/max credible offer?
- Be able to justify what you want
---
## Power in a negotiation
- Really perceived power
- Act as if you're willing to walk away
- Never appear desperate, never “a deal at any price"
- Resist intimidation e.g. flash premises, big title, making you wait
- Transactional analysis: Adult-adult [Games People Play, Eric Berne]
---
## Tilting the playing field in your favour

- Location
- Time
- Numbers
    - Take a colleague?
    - If you do, make sure you are well drilled
    - Good cop, bad cop
    - Try not to sit on opposite sides of the table
- The power of legitimacy
    - The power of the written word
    - List prices
    - Example... maintenance is not negotiable  

---
## Sizing up the situation
Are you in a negotiation or still selling?
Zero-sum or win-win?
Are they willing to work with you?
How skilled a negotiator are they?
Maximisers and satisficers [Schwartz, Swarthmore College]
---
## BATNA
- **B**est **A**lternative **T**o **a** **N**egotiated **A**greement
- An insurance policy
- Gives you confidence
- Two (or more) BATNAs are better than one
- Don’t Reveal a Weak BATNA.
---
## BATNA for sellers
- Only have capacity to work with one customer/partner at the moment
- Consulting: Have a slot for your project, if you miss it...
- Delivery... they need to order now to get it in time
- Important they understand you are in demand
- Time - If they don't buy it, someone else will... soon!
- USP - Features, advantages, BENEFITS
---
## Opening
- Preliminaries
- How to start?
- Attitude, if we do want a win-win situation
---
## Preliminaries
- It's helpful to connect as a human being
- Not being creepy... but less likely to be unethical
- Manners
- Professional, business-like, but friendly and open to discussion
Set the scene... you're there to see if you can reach an agreement and do some business
---
## How to start?
Let them go first?
Research says generally not effective
Perhaps if the issue is complex and they are experienced
If you go first
Anchoring
Maybe better if simple/price negotiation
Leave yourself some negotiating room
Shock them with your first offer?
Go with the highest/lowest credible offer
Attitude, if we do want a win-win situation
Zero-Sum game. Fixed size pie.
By working together on a solution (win-win) can perhaps make a bigger pie
I win, you win, the relationship wins
Create win-win situation
Flexibility, don't dig trenches
Bargaining
The most important (two letter) word in negotiation
Asking questions
Take notes
Beware!
Dealing with angry/pushy negotiators
Price
General tactics
Win-win tactics
Deadlock
The most important (two letter) word in negotiation
IF
Trading
Conceding isn't negotiating
Important to know your negotiables
It’s why negotiation is creative
Asking questions
Like sales
"Great negotiators are great listeners" [Former New York City detective Dominick Misino]
Need to understand their position. Are their requests a real, low or high priority?
If they ask a question, ask one back
Dig. "What's the thinking behind your request?" e.g. Joe memarts
The power of "what if?" - e.g. app developer
Power of silence... when you ask for something
Take notes
Shows you're serious and interested
Gives you thinking time
Stops you reacting
How do you know what you've agreed?!
Summarise
Beware!
The Salami Technique
Nothing is agreed until it's all agreed
Detailed breakdowns
Seller: Avoid
Buyer: Always ask
The worst thing you can do as a negotiator
Split the difference? : NO! : Low/high offer then small movement
Jam tomorrow [Lewis Carroll]
Dealing with angry/pushy negotiators
Don't react
If you do react, don't over-react
Dealing with threats
Are they serious?
Let them blow themselves out
Ask questions
Should you ever lose your temper (or appear to)?
Price
Price reduction request
Once again... ASK QUESTIONS
Is it a real need?
Or are they "just trying it on"?
Focus on total cost
Remind them of all the value they are getting
Don't change the price, change the package
General tactics
Be prepared to justify what you're asking for
You need someone else's permission
The "Mother Hubbard"
Trial balloon e.g. "I hear the going rate is £x/day"
Deadlines : Real or artificial
Budgets: Real or artificial
If you have to throw something in make sure they know the value
Remember your BATNA(s)
Win-win tactics
Think about both the other side's personal and business/organisation objectives
Demands/ultimatums: Acknowledge and reframe to a more positive/joint focus
By working together on a solution (win-win) we can perhaps make a bigger pie
Brainstorm and decide – By brainstorming, you can often find unexpected solutions to difficult negotiations
Address the underlying concern – Honestly address the concern behind a difficult situation
Importance of language - How can we work on this problem together?
Be willing to trade, if it makes sense
Deadlock
Bring in other people, or a third party
Take a step back, then move forward again
Take a "time out"
Avoid postponement
Closing
Careful about pushing your luck... when you've got your main demand adding more and more extras
"It sounds like we have an agreement"
Summarise and shake on it
Make sure there is nothing else... no "Columbo" moment
Agree next steps – Who, what, when?
Writing it up - "If you’ve got it in writing, you’ve got a prayer. If it ain’t in writing, you’ve got thin air"
Don't rub their noses in it, stay professional
Debrief
Follow up
Exercises
What are your negotiables?
What have you negotiated on recently?
Example: You have to hire a dev to do your website/app
How can you practice your negotiating skills?
